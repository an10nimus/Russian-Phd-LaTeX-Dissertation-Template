The need has arisen for a rigorous yet accessible text suitable for graduate students, whatever their scientific background. This book satisfies that need.
The approach taken in this text, is to introduce the basic continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals in equilibria, then it proceeds to simple application of this theory- in particular, there is a discussion of electrical and magnetic field effects which give rise to Freedericksz transitions, which are important in devices. This is followed by an account of dynamic theory and elementary viscometry of nemantics Discussions of backflow and flow-induced instabilities are also included. Smetic theory is also briefly introduced and summarised with some examples of equilibrium solutions as well as those with dynamic effects. A number of mathematical techniques, such as Cartesian tensors and some variational calculus, are presented in the appendices.},

We consider only normal deformations in the nematic material where fluid flow and other dynamic phenomena play no role. Three important sample geometries are considered in the magnetic field, and the experimentally observed deformations are in good agreement with theory. The normal deformation induced by electric fields is of interest from a device standpoint, and we give a solution for the deformation that is valid even for large dielectric anisotropics. This solution has been experimentally verified. We give a detailed comparison of the distortions produced by electric and magnetic fields and show that the deformations are of a similar form even though the field is nonuniform in the electric case. The change in birefringence and electrical capacitance as a function of distortion is discussed as a means of observing the deformation.},

In this paper and the next (paper II), we describe the distortions and energies of bistable planar horizontal and vertical states, and nonplanar twist states in a tilted geometry, using exact numerical solutions of the equilibrium equations as well as a ``boundary-layer'' approximation in the high-field limit. The calculations illustrate the manner in which the distortions become concentrated in boundary layers within a coherence length from the surface, and show the convergence of the planar and nonplanar vertical states at relatively low fields. Implications for the switching mechanism are discussed. In paper II, the boundary-layer model is used to describe the forces governing the movement of disclinations in bistable switching, producing a quantitative description of their velocity and justification for a mobility-limited switching time.},

It is shown that this transition can be either of the second order or of the first order depending on the values of the Frank constants, pitch, surface energies, and the cell thickness. A simple criterion that determines the order of the phase transition is obtained. By numerically minimizing the free energy of the liquid-crystal pattern the distribution of the director in the presence of the external electric field is calculated. For this purpose the polar angle of the director was presented as a partial sum of the Fourier series and of the appropriate function. The azimuthal angle was eliminated using Euler-Lagrange equations. Calculations were performed for different sets of liquid-crystal parameters which provide the phase transition of the first and of the second order. The numerical results are in a good agreement with theoretical formulas based on the Landau-type theory.},

  abstract  = {The book intends to give a state-of-the-art overview of flexoelectricity, a linear physical coupling between mechanical (orientational) deformations and electric polarization, which is specific to systems with orientational order, such as liquid crystals. 
Chapters written by experts in the field shed light on theoretical as well as experimental aspects of research carried out since the discovery of flexoelectricity. Besides a common macroscopic (continuum) description the microscopic theory of flexoelectricity is also addressed. Electro-optic effects due to or modified by flexoelectricity as well as various (direct and indirect) measurement methods are discussed. Special emphasis is given to the role of flexoelectricity in pattern-forming instabilities. 

While the main focus of the book lies in flexoelectricity in nematic liquid crystals, peculiarities of other mesophases (bent-core systems, cholesterics, and smectics) are also reviewed. Flexoelectricity has relevance to biological (living) systems and can also offer possibilities for technical applications. The basics of these two interdisciplinary fields are also summarized.

	with continuum theory(1) for both types of liquid crystal. This paper
	discusses the influence upon such a twisted orientation pattern of
	a magnetic field perpendicular to the plates. If one employs a free
	energy of the form discussed by Frank,(2) the continuum theory equations
	have solutions relevant to this situation. For nematic liquid crystals,
	provided that the twist is not too large, our analysis suggests that
	no distortion of the orientation pattern occurs until the magnetic
	field strength exceeds a critical value which varies with the amount
	of twist. For cholesteric liquid crystals, there seems to be two
	possibilities depending upon the relative magnitudes of two Frank
	constants. Either distortion always occurs above a critical field
	strength, or does so only when the distance between the plates is
	sufficiently small.},

  abstract  = {Optical phased arrays represent an enabling new technology that makes possible simple affordable, lightweight, optical sensors offering very precise stabilization, random-access pointing programmable multiple simultaneous beams, a dynamic focus/defocus capability, and moderate to excellent optical power handling capability. These new arrays steer or otherwise operate on an already formed beam. A phase profile is imposed on an optical beam as it is either transmitted through or reflected from the phase shifter array. The imposed phase profile steers, focuses, fans out, or corrects phase aberrations on the beam. The array of optical phase shifters is realized through lithographic patterning of an electrical addressing network on the superstrate of a liquid crystal waveplate. Refractive index changes sufficiently large to realize full-wave differential phase shifts can be effected using low (<10 V) voltages applied to the liquid crystal phase plate electrodes. High efficiency large-angle steering with phased arrays requires phase shifter spacing on the order of a wavelength or less; consequently addressing issues make 1-D optical arrays much more practical than 2-D arrays. Orthogonal oriented 1-D phased arrays are used to deflect a beam in both dimensions. Optical phased arrays with apertures on the order of 4 cm by 4 cm have been fabricated for steering green, red, 1.06 /spl mu/m, and 10.6 /spl mu/m radiation. System concepts that include a passive acquisition sensor as well as a laser radar are presented.},

It is shown that the temperature variations of the pitch in a layer are of a universal character. This is manifested in the fact that they depend not separately on the parameters of the sample but only on one dimensionless parameter Sd=K22/dW, where K22 is the torsional modulus in the Frank elastic energy, W is the height of the surface-anchoring potential, and d is the thickness of the layer. The investigation is performed the parameter Sdin a range where the change per unit number of cholesteric half-turns within the thickness of the layer accompanying a change in the temperature is due to the slipping of the director on the surface of the layer through the potential barrier for surface anchoring. The critical values of the parameter Sd(which are most easily attained experimentally by varying the thickness of the layer), determining the region of applicability of the approach employed, are presented. The temperature variations of the free energy of the layer and the pitch of the cholesteric helix in the layer as well as the temperature hysteresis in the variations of the pitch with increasing and decreasing temperature are investigated for the corresponding values of Sd. Numerical calculations of the quantities mentioned above are performed using the Rapini anchoring potential.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of pitch jumps in cholesteric layers with a finite surface anchoring strength under variations in temperature is investigated theoretically. General expressions are presented that connect the dynamics of pitch jumps with the parameters that determine the process, such as the viscosity, the specific form of the anchoring potential, and the dimensionless parameter Sd= K22/Wd, where W is the depth of the anchoring potential, K22 is the twist elastic modulus, and d is the layer thickness. It is found that the shape of the anchoring potential significantly influences the temporal behavior of the cholesteric helix in the process of a pitch jump. To illustrate this revealed dependence of the pitch jump dynamics on the shape and strength of the anchoring potential, the problem was investigated for two different models of the surface anchoring potential for a jump mechanism in connection with the director at the surface slipping over the barrier of the anchoring potential. Calculations for the unwinding (winding) of the helix in the process of the jump were performed to investigate the case of infinitely strong anchoring on one surface and finite anchoring on the other, which is important in applications. The results show that an experimental investigation of the dynamics of the pitch jumps will make it possible to distinguish different shapes of the finite strength anchoring potential and, in particular, it will provide a means for determining whether the well-known Rapini-Papoular anchoring potential is the best suited potential relevant to the dynamics of pitch jumps in cholesteric layers with a finite surface anchoring strength. The optimal conditions for experimental observation of these phenomena are briefly considered.},

  abstract  = {The structure of a straight interface (wall) between regions with differing values
of the pitch in planar cholesteric layers with finite strength of the surface
anchoring is investigated theoretically. It is found that the shape and strength
of the anchoring potential influences essentially the structure of the wall and a
motionless wall between thermodynamically stable regions without a singularity in the
director distribution in the layer can exist for sufficiently weak anchoring only.
More specifically, for the existence of such a wall the dimensionless parameter
Sd = K22/Wd (where
W is the depth of the
anchoring potential, K22 is the
elastic twist modulus and d 
is the layer thickness) should exceed its critical value, which is dependent on
the shape of the anchoring potential. General equations describing the director
distribution in the wall are presented. Detailed analysis of these equations is
carried out for the case of infinitely strong anchoring at one surface and finite
anchoring strength at the second layer surface. It is shown that the wall width
L is
directly dependent upon the shape and strength of the anchoring potential and that its estimate ranges
from d 
to (dLp)1/2 
(where Lp = K22/W 
is the penetration length), corresponding to different anchoring strengths and shape
potentials. The dependence of the director distribution in the wall upon all three Frank
elastic moduli is analytically found for some specific limiting cases of the model anchoring
potentials. Motion of the wall is briefly investigated and the corresponding calculations
performed under the assumption that the shape of a moving wall is the same as a
motionless one. It is noted that experimental investigation of the walls in planar cholesteric
layers can be used for the determination of the actual shape of surface anchoring potentials.},

  abstract = {Increasing interest in helmet-mounted displays (HMDs) has fueled research in variable transmittance visors (VTVs) because a VTV can reduce glare and increase HMD contrast in bright lighting conditions. The ideal VTV will be an electrically controllable light valve that allows the pilot to adjust visor transmittance (tint) to the level appropriate to the ambient lighting conditions. Liquid- crystal based devices can provide an efficient method for accomplishing this. Because flight helmets utilize polycarbonate visors, VTVs must be implemented on complex curved, plastic substrates. Liquid crystal devices, however, are typically implemented on flat glass substrates. We present a novel system, Variable Attenuation Liquid Crystal Device (VALiD), which can be utilized for this application. VALiD is a dichroic dye and liquid crystal based guest-host system. Our specific configuration allows for a fast system that fails to the clear state. Furthermore, the degree of polarization dependence can be tailored for use in different applications. VALiD has been implemented on thin, flexible, flat plastic substrates. Recently, this has been extended to doubly curved polycarbonate substrates and a prototype has been fabricated. In this paper we present the characteristics of this technology.},

The lasing action is attributed to the combination of the fluorescence and the distributed feedback that are due to the inherent periodic structure of the liquid crystal. If the reflection band matches the intrinsic emission of the cholesteric liquid crystal, the crystal becomes a natural laser material, which will self-lase, without any optical elements or the addition of dyes, under picosecond excitation at 355??‰??‰nm. Samples have been made to lase at different wavelengths in the near UV by shifting of the edge of the reflection band in the range of 385--405??‰??‰nm. Typical linewidths observed are of the order of 0.5??‰??‰nm.},

The cholesteric cell can be switched between two states:?(1) flat layers of a planar cholesteric texture and (2) a square lattice of periodic director modulation associated with layer undulations that produces 2D diffraction patterns. The intensities of the diffraction maxima can be tuned by changing the applied field. The diffractive properties can be optimized for different wavelengths by appropriately choosing cholesteric pitch, cell thickness, and surface treatment.},

Tricritical behavior of the FrпїЅedericksz transition in ferronematics induced by magnetic field is revealed. It is found out that this transition can be either first- or second-order transition depending on the segregation degree. We derive the analytical expression for the tricritical segregation parameter, determining the phase-transition character change. The dependence of birefringence on the external magnetic field and the segregation parameter is studied.},

  abstract  = {A theoretical investigation is made into the dynamics of pitch jumps in cholesteric liquid-crystal layers having finite strength surface-anchoring conditions. A presentation is given of general formulations which connect the dynamics of pitch jumps with the key material parameters such as the viscosity, the specific form of the anchoring potential, and the dimensionless parameter S_d=K_22/Wd, where K_22 is the elastic modulus, W is the depth of the anchoring potential, and d is the layer thickness. To illustrate the dependence of the pitch jump dynamics upon the shape and strength of the anchoring potential, we investigate two sets of different model surface-anchoring potentials for a jump mechanism that is connected with the slipping of the director at a surface over the barrier of the anchoring potential. Two types of “narrow” well potentials that are natural extensions of the more familiar “wide” potentials are considered: one type is based upon the well-known Rapini-Papoular potential and the other upon the B potential, introduced in Belyakov, Stewart, and Osipov, JETP 99, 73 (2004). Calculations for the unwinding (winding) of the helix in the process of the jump were performed to investigate the case of infinitely strong anchoring on one surface and finite anchoring on the other, which is important in applications. The results show that an experimental investigation of the dynamics of the pitch jumps will allow one to distinguish different shapes of the finite strength anchoring potential, and will, in particular, provide a means for determining whether or not the well-known Rapini-Papoular anchoring potential is the best suited potential relevant to the dynamics of pitch jumps in cholesteric layers with finite surface-anchoring strength.},

The cases of positive and negative anisotropies of magnetic susceptibility or permittivity are considered. The calculations are based on the division of degrees of freedom into bulk and surface ones and on the reduction of the computation of the continual integral determining the correlation function to the solution of the Euler equation with corresponding boundary conditions of the first or third kind. The obtained correlation functions are used for describing the intensity of light scattered in nematics for the planar and homeotropic orientations. It is shown, in particular, that the measurements of the angular dependence of the scattered light intensity may serve as a reliable method for determining the energy of anchoring of a liquid crystal to a substrate for different values of the external field.},

  abstract  = {We analyze stability of the planar orientational structure in a nematic-liquid-crystal cell with planar anchoring conditions at both substrates. Specifically, we study the instabilities of the ground state caused by surface elasticity with the saddle-splay elastic constant K24 violating the Ericksen inequalities. We express the surface part of static correlation functions as a functional integral over the fluctuation field induced by director fluctuations at confining walls and derive the stability conditions for the planar structure with respect to the fluctuation modes characterized by the in-plane wave numbers and by the parity. These conditions are analyzed in the cell thicknessпїЅfluctuation wavelength plane through the parametrization for the boundary curve of the instability region. For relatively small K24, the fluctuation mode of the critical wavelength is found to render the structure unstable when the thickness of the cell is below its critical value. The parity of the critical mode changes as the twist-splay ratio K2/K1 is passing through unity. Further increase of K24 beyond the second threshold value, 4K1K2/(K1+K2), leads to the instability with respect to short wavelength fluctuations regardless of the cell thickness. We compute the critical thickness and the critical wavelength as a function of K24, the twist-splay ratio, and the azimuthal anchoring strength.},
