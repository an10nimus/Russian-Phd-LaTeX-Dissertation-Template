  abstract  = {It is shown theoretically that due to the flexoelectric effect the electric field driven Frèedericksz transition can take place in chiral nematic (cholesteric) liquid crystal with negative dielectric anisotropy. It is especially noteworthy, since such a transition in a plane parallel cell is impossible in the absence of flexoelectricity. The spatial inhomogeneity of the electric field is is taken into account in the free energy alongside with the traditionally considered terms, describing the orientation elasticity and the anchoring at the boundaries. The phase diagrams are plotted and the orientation structures above the threshold are analyzed basing on the free energy minimization. A comparison between the phase diagrams for liquid crystals with positive and negative anisotropy of dielectric permittivity is made. It was found, that for sufficiently high flexoelectric coefficients the orientational structure can be described by simple functions. In this case, as a result of the Frèedericksz transition, the orientation structure of the liquid crystal changes from planar helicoidal to a hybrid one. This gives rise to new opportunities for the design of switching devices.},

  abstract  = {Transformation of the orientational structure in a plane-parallel cell of a cholesteric liquid crystal, was studied depending on the magnitude of the voltage applied to the boundary planes of the cell. The equilibrium configuration of the liquid crystal director field was found minimizing the free energy both analitically and numerically. We took into account the orientational elastic energy in the volume and at the cell boundaries, the energy of an inhomogeneous electric field, and the flexoelectric effect. Systems with large flexoelectric coefficient were studied in detail. It was found, that when small voltages are applied to the cell boundaries, a continuous Fredericks transition occurs first, and then, when certain characteristic voltage is achieved, a significant jump-like change in the orientational structure takes place, and this structure gradually changes with the further voltage increase. It is shown that various scenarios of transformation of the orientational structure can be implemented depending on the actual values of the set of material parameters of the system studied. The discovered ability to control the structure of a liquid crystal in a cell can find use in various technical devices.},
